# Sample Code HRE 0002

This folder contains an HRE starter pack, constructed within the Eclipse RCP
IDE, as this is the intended development environment for HRE.

It consists of sample code (and its required images) to setup and display the
HRE Menu system and a simple ‘About HRE’ splash screen in Eclipse.

It does conform to the HRE specifications for the menu layout for the planned
v0.1 to v0.6 development, but is otherwise considered to be **THROW-AWAY code
ONLY**. It was built to test the use of Eclipse as a suitable platform, NOT as a
base for HRE development. It does not conform to any coding standard other than
Eclipse code generation rules.

It does **NOT** observe the module naming laid out in the HRE specification
documents.

It does **NOT** conform to OSGi requirements.
